# Automated processing of legal documents for GDPR compliance 
### Client

Swedish law company

  


### Problem

A Swedish law firm struggled with manually checking client documents for GDPR compliance. We developed a semi-automated tool that assessed these documents against GDPR standards, summarizing which criteria were met. Users accessed this tool through a Microsoft Word plugin.

  


  


### Solution

The semi-automated solution validated documents to see if they met GDPR criteria and prepared a summary of passed and not passed criteria. The person needed to validate the result and approve it.

Users use the Office 365 plugin, which allows them to get assistance while using Microsoft Word.

The initial solution was built before OpenAI was released. OpenAI improved the quality of the processing logic (decreasing errors by 80%). 

  


### Technologies

* Python


* Office 365 SDK


* Milvus


* Azure OpenAI



  


### Economic effect

The solution decreased the average time required to process documents by 70%.
