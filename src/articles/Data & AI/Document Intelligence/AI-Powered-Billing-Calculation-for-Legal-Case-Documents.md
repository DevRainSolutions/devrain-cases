# AI-Powered Billing Calculation for Legal Case Documents  
### Introduction

A U.S. law firm specializing in personal injury cases was spending a lot of time manually calculating all the costs related to their cases. They had to review invoices and receipts from many providers, each with its format and logic. This took a lot of time and led to potential revenue loss because they weren’t always applying the correct interest rates for costs from previous years.

  


### Solution

DevRain developed an AI-powered tool to automate the billing calculation process. This tool reduced the effort required by about 90%. Here’s how it helped:

* Advanced Text Recognition: The AI could read text from images, even if they were of poor quality.


* Understanding Different Formats: It could process various invoice and receipt formats, no matter how different.


* Duplicate Detection: The tool identified duplicate receipts to prevent counting them more than once.


* Automatic Interest Calculation: It automatically applies the correct interest rates to previous years' costs.


* Detailed Calculation Reports: The AI clearly explained how it calculated the costs, which the firm’s employees could use in court.


* Human Review: When the AI cannot recognize a document, a person checks it to ensure accuracy.



  


### Challenges

* Varied Document Formats: The firm received invoices and receipts that looked very different from each other, making it hard to standardize the calculations.


* Duplicate Receipts: Some receipts were duplicates of ones they had already processed, which could lead to errors if counted twice.


* Poor Image Quality: Many documents were hard to read because of low image quality, making it difficult for software to recognize the text.



  


### Results

* Time Savings: The firm reduced the time spent on billing calculations by 90%.


* Improved Accuracy: Automation reduced errors that could happen with manual calculations.


* Faster Case Processing: Quicker calculations allowed the firm to close cases faster and improve client satisfaction.



  


### Conclusion

DevRain’s AI-powered calculation engine transformed the firm’s billing process. The firm saved time and money by automating a complex and time-consuming task and provided better client service.
