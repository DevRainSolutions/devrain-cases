LIGA Zakon: Customer Support with a Multilingual Intelligent Chatbot (TBD)
LIGA Zakon, despite boasting a range of successful products, grappled with inefficiencies stemming from a cumbersome customer support process. The ambition was to refine and automate customer interactions, ensuring queries were swiftly categorized into distinctive types such as "general", "technical", or "financial", and this across multiple languages. The resolution was the integration of an intelligent chatbot, meticulously designed to be a repository of a comprehensive FAQ section, and empowered with a custom machine learning model. This model was nurtured with insights gleaned from historical customer conversations, enabling it to proficiently navigate through customer queries. Equipped with language detection capabilities and a mechanism for evaluating responses, the chatbot emerged as a transformative solution, heralding a new era of efficiency and responsiveness in LIGA Zakon’s customer support ecosystem.
