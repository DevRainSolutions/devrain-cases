### How UAnimals Transformed Their Support System with AI
In the heart of Ukraine, amidst the chaos of war, UAnimals has been a beacon of hope for countless animals. This organization, dedicated to animal welfare, faced an overwhelming challenge: managing the surge of queries from their compassionate community of over 300,000 supporters.

The need for efficient communication and timely dissemination of information was critical to maintaining engagement and participation in their noble cause.

**The Problem**
The war in Ukraine has had devastating effects on both people and animals. [According to UAnimals, the number of cats and dogs in shelters increased by 60% in the first year of the war alone.](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/press-conference/944817.html) [The Ukrainian Pet Association Worldwide (UPAW) reported that around 140,000 animals needed volunteer help.](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/press-conference/944817.html) ![](https://devrain.blob.core.windows.net/cases/UAnimals_3.png)The sheer volume of requests for assistance was staggering, and UAnimals struggled to keep up.
The situation was dire. Ukraine is among the top ten countries with the largest number of stray animals, and the war exacerbated this issue. ![](https://devrain.blob.core.windows.net/cases/UAnimals_2.png)
[**Oksana Koshak**](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/press-conference/944817.html)[, co-founder of UPAW, highlighted that 84% of the animals caught by municipal animal control in Lviv had been abandoned by their owners.](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/press-conference/944817.html) Additionally, the lack of a unified system for pet registration and vaccination further complicated efforts to manage the crisis.
The war’s impact on animals extended beyond domestic pets. [According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, as of June 2022, the official estimated number of animals killed since the invasion began included 42,000 sheep, 92,000 cattle, 258,000 pigs, and more than 5.7 million poultry.](https://uwecworkgroup.info/animal-victims-of-war/) [](https://interfax.com.ua/news/press-conference/1025592.html)These numbers are likely higher due to the challenges in data collection during active hostilities.
As the crisis deepened, the volume of information and help requests dramatically increased. UAnimals was inundated with queries from concerned citizens, volunteers, and international supporters. The organization needed a robust system to manage this influx efficiently.

**Solution**
Faced with these overwhelming challenges, UAnimals turned to technology for a solution. They integrated an OpenAI-powered chatbot into their customer support system. This intelligent chatbot was designed to handle frequently asked questions (FAQs), providing immediate and accurate responses to common queries. The integration of this AI solution optimized the organization’s response time, ensuring that supporters received essential information promptly.

**_Liudmyla, the Head of the Communication Department_**, explains, “_The chatbot has been a game-changer for us. It allows us to provide immediate support to our community, ensuring that no query goes unanswered_.”

**Implementation**
The journey to integrate the chatbot was meticulous. UAnimals first identified the most common queries and information needs of their supporters. The chatbot was then tailored to provide relevant and accurate responses, drawing from a comprehensive database of FAQs. After seamless integration into UAnimals’ existing customer support infrastructure, continuous testing and optimization ensured the chatbot’s performance met the organization’s standards.

**Impact**
The results were transformative. The chatbot significantly reduced the response time for common queries, allowing human staff to focus on more complex issues. Supporters received timely and accurate information, enhancing their engagement and participation in UAnimals’ initiatives. The chatbot also provided a scalable solution to handle increasing volumes of queries as UAnimals’ supporter base grew.

**Conclusion**
The integration of the OpenAI-powered chatbot has been a pivotal step for UAnimals.
