**Challenge**

  

1. **Slow quoting:** Sales reps spent up to 30 minutes per customer compiling quotes because product data lived in silos.
2. **Weak competitive positioning:** Identifying equivalent or superior alternatives to rival SKUs required manual research.
3. **Poor searchability:** Over 80 % of catalogue items lacked complete metadata, crippling search and cross‑sell efforts.

  
  

**Solution**

1. AI-based process allows sales managers to upload any invoice format to the Platform and receive an AI-generated quote for alternative products. AI uses a complex recommendation algorithm to propose the right product, based on the agreement with manufacturers, margin, and specifications match.
2. AI-based enrichment process is used to populate the product's metadata.
3. AI-based search provides users with more accurate results and allows them to find alternative products for any input information (SKU, name, etc.).

  
  

**Summary**

*   70 % reduction in quote preparation time.
*   95 % of the catalogue now has complete, standardised metadata.
*   Zero ramp‑up gap: New reps quote as fast as tenured staff within one week.
