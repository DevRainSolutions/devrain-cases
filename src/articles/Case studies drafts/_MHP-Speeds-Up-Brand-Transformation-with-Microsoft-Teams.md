# MHP Speeds Up Brand Transformation with Microsoft Teams

### **_Summary_**
In the heart of Ukraine, MHP, an international agriculture company, embarked on a transformative journey to create a digital workplace for its employees. This initiative aimed to foster collaboration, enhance productivity, and streamline operations across its global workforce. The story of this transformation is one of innovation, resilience, and a commitment to excellence.
### Challenge
MHP encountered a significant challenge: unifying its diverse and geographically dispersed teams under a single digital framework. Despite the company's maturity in business processes, both communication and collaboration tools, along with the processes themselves, were fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of cohesion. The objective was clear â€“ to establish a seamless digital workplace that would enable employees to work together effectively, regardless of their location.
### Solution and Methodology
To address the challenge of unifying MHP's diverse and geographically dispersed teams, a comprehensive digital framework was established. This framework integrated various Microsoft 365 applications, creating a cohesive and efficient environment for collaboration and data management. Over 5,000 employees were trained to use these tools effectively, ensuring a smooth transition and high adoption rates.

The core features of the new digital workplace include advanced communication tools, real-time collaboration capabilities, and robust data management systems. Virtual meetings, chat, and file sharing were facilitated, while secure document storage and collaboration were provided through SharePoint and OneDrive. Power BI was integrated to offer powerful data analytics and visualization, enabling teams to make informed decisions based on real-time data.

Key HR functions were seamlessly integrated into a single interface, enhancing efficiency and user experience. Payroll and employee benefits/awards management were streamlined through integration with ERP and SAP APIs. The company bus schedule was managed using data from the ERP API, ensuring timely updates and notifications. The onboarding flow was automated with Power Automate, reducing manual tasks and improving the onboarding experience. The office map feature was enhanced with data from the Microsoft Graph API, providing real-time updates and easy navigation.

Business features encompassed approvals workflow, an analytics center, and a global messaging service. These were supported by integrations with various third-party systems such as K2 BPM API for workflow automation, PowerBI API for data analytics, and Telegram API for global messaging. The Microsoft Bot Framework, SMS API, and Telegram API were utilized to create a robust global messaging service, ensuring seamless communication across the organization.

Custom applications were developed using the Microsoft Power Platform to address specific business needs and streamline operations.

This integrated approach not only addressed the initial challenge but also transformed MHP's digital workplace, fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration across the organization.
### Conclusion
The transformation of MHP's digital workplace had a profound impact on the organization. Employees reported a 30% increase in productivity, better communication, and a greater sense of connection with their colleagues.
