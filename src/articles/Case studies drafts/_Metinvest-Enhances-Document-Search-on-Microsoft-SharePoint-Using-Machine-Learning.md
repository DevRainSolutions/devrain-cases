### Challenge
Metinvest, a leading international steel and mining group, faced significant challenges in managing and searching through terabytes of data stored on Microsoft SharePoint. Like many large enterprises, they struggled with inefficient document search and retrieval processes, compounded by the complexity of access management, security, and data governance. The redundancy and duplication of documents added to the chaos, making it difficult to maintain consistent document quality and format. Additionally, the manual categorization and sorting of documents were time-consuming and resource-intensive, leading to delays and inefficiencies.
### **Solution**
To address these challenges, Metinvest partnered with DevRain to develop an advanced multilingual search system enhanced with machine learning. This innovative solution was designed to improve document management efficiency and effectiveness. DevRain's machine learning-enhanced system provided several key features that transformed Metinvest's document management approach. The multilingual search supported full-text, attribute-based, and category-based searches, enabling users to find relevant documents quickly and efficiently, regardless of the language. The system's ability to identify and link related documents provided users with a more connected and contextual understanding of their data. By recognizing relationships between documents, it helped users navigate through relevant materials seamlessly, enhancing the overall document management experience.

The feature that discovered and flagged duplicate documents optimized storage and streamlined data management. This reduced redundancy, saved storage space, and ensured that users were always working with the most current and accurate versions of their documents. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the system could extract key data insights from documents. This feature allowed users to quickly identify and utilize important information without manually sifting through extensive content, thereby increasing productivity and decision-making efficiency. Automated document categorization based on content significantly reduced the time and effort required for manual sorting. This automated process ensured that documents were organized logically and consistently, facilitating easier retrieval and management.
### **Conclusion**
The integration of DevRain's machine learning solution into Metinvest's document management system led to significant improvements. The automated processes and advanced search capabilities decreased the time required to manage and retrieve documents. The multilingual search system and document linking features enhanced the relevance and accuracy of document searches. Duplicate detection reduced redundancy and saved storage space. Key data insights and automated categorization streamlined workflows and improved decision-making. By leveraging DevRain's advanced machine learning algorithms, Metinvest transformed their document management approach, making it more efficient and effective. This case study highlights the importance of integrating innovative technologies to address complex document management challenges in large organizations.)
